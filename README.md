# ICT4D
This repository contains a voice-accessible service for cereal seed certification prototype project.



# CertifiSeeds
CertifiSeeds is a interactive voice response system developed to improve the certification process, focussing mainly on improving the efficiency of the certification process through digitizing current services with the voice-based system and a shared database for certification data.


# How does it work
This prototype allows farmers to call an interactive voice system (IVR) that provides different functionalities such as: confirming or changing appointment date, information retrieval of certificates and retrieval of union information. The IVR will answer the call and provide several menus in order to fullfill the needs of the farmer. The current prototype is still in the early stages and is open for further development.
