#How does it work
This prototype allows farmers to call an interactive voice system (IVR) that provides different functionalities such as: confirming or changing appointment date, information retrieval of certificates and retrieval of union information. The IVR will answer the call and provide several menus in order to fullfill the needs of the farmer. The current prototype is still in the early stages and is open for further development
